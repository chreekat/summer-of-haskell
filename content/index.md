# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by Haskell.Org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors. This program is open to all college students and newcomers
to open-source Haskell contributions, age 18 years or older, in most countries.

We are pleased to announce that <em>Haskell.Org</em> in collaboration with the
<em>Haskell Foundation</em> will be hosting the <b>Summer of Haskell 2023</b>!
This program will be occurring independently from <i>Google Summer of Code</i>
but offers the same opportunities, including mentorship and a stipend, to
would-be Haskell contributors.

### Participation

We will begin accepting proposals from prospective contributors starting April
3rd, and the deadline for submissions is April 20th. If you would like to apply,
please send an email to `summer [AT] haskell.org` with a Google doc containing
your proposal. Tips for writing a good proposal can be found
[here](/tips.html). We have a curated list of [project ideas](/ideas.html)
that you can select from, or you may also propose an idea of your own if
you'd prefer.

Our guidelines around contributor eligibility as well as the stipend will
mirror those of <i>Google Summer of Code</i>. See
[here](./faq.html#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-for-participation)
for eligibility guidelines, and [here](/stipend.html) for stipend information.
Please be sure to review the eligibility guidelines before you start working on
a proposal.
