### What is the main goal of this program?
Our main goal is to attract people outside the ecosystem to the Haskell
open-source code development. We hope program attendees stay with the
open-source movement after finishing their projects to continue contributing.

---

### What is the timeline for the Summer of Haskell program?
The full timeline for the 2023 edition can be found on the [homepage](/#projected-timeline).

Estimates for medium-size projects: 175 hours to complete; large projects: 350
hours to complete. The program (work schedule) can be modified individually in
case a student's school ends late/starts early and collides with the Summer of
Haskell timeline.

---

### What are the eligibility requirements for participation?

 -  You must be eligible to work in the country you will reside in during the
    program, and the United States cannot embargo the country you reside in.
 -  You must be at least 18 years old before the program's inauguration.
 -  Summer of Haskell cannot accept participants (contributors or mentors) from
    Russia, Belarus, or the so-called Donetsk People's Republic ("DNR") and
    Luhansk People's Republic ("LNR"), but there are no restrictions on
    participants in Ukraine but outside of the DNR and LNR.

---

### How does the program work?
Newcomers are mentored by experienced contributors, and learn how to work with
open source software development and improve their ability to write Haskell
code. No previous open source experience is needed to participate in the
program as a contributor, however you need to have some knowledge of writing
Haskell code. The program is addressed to everyone; there's no need to be a
student. All the contributors will receive a stipend for their work, even if
the work is unfinished or the produced code won't be used in the future. The
program is run entirely online.

---

### Is it possible to be a contributor and mentor at the same time?
No, by definition, contributors are not experienced with open source while all
the mentors are experienced contributors and maintainers.

---

### Why are you running this program?
The Haskell ecosystem relies on volunteer work. The majority of tools and
libraries are open source and we want to be aware and educate developers on the
importance of open source software. Having active contributors and devoted
maintainers is crucial for our ecosystem to function smoothly.

---

### Are mentoring organizations required to use the code produced by students?
No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a
happy home, we don't require organizations to use the contributor's code.

---

### Can I take part in the project as a group of contributors?
No, we accept only individuals as contributors.

---

### Can I submit more than one proposal?
We accept at most two proposals from each candidate.

---

### How to write a good project proposal?
Please see our [tips for writing a good proposal](./tips.html)

---

### How do I know that I've been accepted?
We will contact you via email and ask you to prepare a tax form applicable to
your country (our stipend program requirement). In case you are a student in
the United States on an F1 visa - be sure to get in touch with your school's
international student affairs office immediately to confirm if you can accept
the stipend for the project.

---

### Can I get course credit for participating in the Summer of Haskell?
You have to confirm that with your school program coordinators.

---

###  How do I become a mentor for Summer of Haskell?
If you are a community member who is maintaining an active free/open source
software project under an Open Source Initiative approved license, please write
to `summer [AT] haskell.org`.

---

### Are there any other ways to support Summer of Haskell?
We are looking for sponsors of stipends; the number we're suggesting to
potential sponsors is 6000 USD. If that is outside your means, you can also
co-sponsor a student by providing half the stipend for a student.

---

### What if I have another question?
We are happy to answer! Write us an email summer<at>haskell.org. Please
remember not to leave your submission to the program until the very last
minute.
